An interest rate is the percentage of principal charged by the lender for the use of its money. The principal is the amount of money loaned.
The bank applies the interest rate to the total unpaid portion of your loan or credit card balance, and you must pay at least the interest in each compounding period. If not, your outstanding debt will increase even though you are making payments.3﻿
Although interest rates are very competitive, they aren't the same. A bank will charge higher interest rates if it thinks there's a lower chance the debt will get repaid. For that reason, banks will tend to assign a higher interest rate to revolving loans such as credit cards, as these types of loans are more expensive to manage. Banks also charge higher rates to people they consider risky; The higher your credit score, the lower the interest rate you will have to pay.4
The annual interest rate is the rate over a period of one year. Other interest rates apply over different periods, such as a month or a day, but they are usually annualised.
